                    <p>This booklet was designed to help people living with 
                        bleeding disorders identify common joint and muscle bleeds 
                        in their earliest stages, so that proper treatment can begin 
                        as soon as possible.<br><br>It is written to help people of 
                        all ages perform a self-assessment and to help parents assess 
                        their children.<br><br>This booklet will assist you to:</p>

                            joint and muscle bleeds;</li>

                            (Htc);</li>

                    </ul>
                    <p>Prompt recognition and immediate treatment of joint and muscle bleeds is critical to prevent 
                        long-term problems. Your bleeding disorder treatment centre will work with you to develop a treatment plan. 
                        This might involve travelling to the Htc, or attending a local health care facility, or treating yourself 
                        with product in the home.</p>
                    <p>In addition to using products to stop the bleeding, other techniques such as rest, compression, and avoiding
                        weight-bearing activities are also important to prevent long - term problems. Returning to regular activities,
                        such as sports or work, too soon may delay healing or cause a new bleed. Accurate home care records (infusion
                        logs, bleeding diaries) and regular visits to the hemophilia clinic are also essential components of
                        comprehensive hemophilia treatment.</p>

                    <p>A parent may notice that the child is limping, or having difficulty moving a limb.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The person with the bleeding disorder will notice:</li>
                        <li><i class="TTiny material-icons">stop</i>stiffness or a "tingling" sensation;</li>
                        <li><i class="TTiny material-icons">stop</i>discomfort at rest and with movement.</li>
                        <li style="padding-top:3%">Swelling may not be obvious immediately, so it is important to look for:</li>
                        <li><i class="TTiny material-icons">stop</i>warmth over the joint; the joint feels warmer compared to surrounding tissues;</li>
                        <li><i class="TTiny material-icons">stop</i>loss of motion compared to the opposite arm or leg OR the usual amount of motion;</li>
                        <li><i class="TTiny material-icons">stop</i>tenderness to touch.</li>
                        <li style="padding-top:3%">If bleeding continues, there will be:</li>
                        <li><i class="TTiny material-icons">stop</i>swelling;</li>
                        <li><i class="TTiny material-icons">stop</i>pain;</li>
                        <li><i class="TTiny material-icons">stop</i>and possibly redness.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h5 style="color:#00b8d4;padding-top:4%"><b>TREATMENT OF A JOINT BLEED</b></h5>
                    <p>The first aid principles of R-R-I-I-C-E are recommended for all joint bleeds.</p>
                    <p><b>R = Replacement</b> of clotting factor. Treat with factor <b>as directed by your treatment centre.</b></p>
                    <p><b>R = Rest.</b> Do not use this joint while it is painful or swollen. Use crutches or a wheelchair when there is a joint bleed in the leg. Use a sling to rest arm bleeds.</p>
                    <p><b>I = Ice.</b> Ice may help to decrease pain. An ice pack, gel pack or crushed ice can be used. Always wrap the ice in a damp towel first; do not apply ice directly to the skin.
                        For best relief, wrap the ice completely around the joint. For small joints, leave the ice on for 5-10 minutes; for larger joints, up to 20 minutes may be needed. Reapply the ice every two hours for the first two to three days, or until the pain has decreased. <b>Do not use ice if it is making the pain worse.</b></p>
<p><b>I = Immobilization.</b> If the joint is very swollen or if movement is lost, a splint or half cast may be used to protect the joint. Splints can also be useful for young children who may not understand that they need to rest. See page 24 - WHEN TO IMMOBILIZE.
Your HTC/physiotherapist will advise you what type of immobilization should be used and for how long.</p>
<p><b>C = Compression.</b> A tensor bandage or an elastic sleeve will support the joint and help to control the swelling; however compression may not be tolerated if the joint is very tender. Circulation must be watched carefully. <b>If there is any numbness or tingling, remove the compression immediately.</b></p>
<p><b>E = Elevation.</b> Keeping the injured part six inches above the level of the heart will decrease the pressure on the damaged blood vessels and help slow the swelling.</p>
<h5 style="color:#00b8d4;padding-top:4%"><b>FOR ALL JOINT BLEEDS</b></h5>
<p>After any joint bleed, there will be inflammation inside the joint as it heals. This is a normal part of healing and can last for several weeks, even though the joint may look normal and move well. Stopping treatment too soon, or going back to all activities before this inflammation is resolved, may cause a new bleed. <b>Treatment, as directed by your HTC, must be continued until the joint has returned to normal.</b></p>
                    <div class="card-panel cyan lighten-4">
                        <b style="color:#00b8d4">NOTE:</b>&nbsp Some older people, or those who have had many bleeds, may have some chronic joint damage which permanently restricts motion and alters the appearance of the joint. In these cases, the treatment plan must be continued for each new bleed until the joint returns to its <b>usual pre-bleed state.</b> Your physiotherapist can help you with this by checking your joint function after each bleed and comparing with your annual assessment results.

                    <p>Muscle bleeds are less common than joint bleeds. As a result, many people don't have the same understanding about bleeding into muscles: "oh, it's only a pulled muscle". <b>In fact, muscle bleeds can be more serious than joint bleeds because of their complications.</b></p>
                    <img class="responsive-img" src="./image/9.png" style="float:right;padding-left:2%">
                    <p>In some large muscles, outside swelling is not always obvious at first, because the blood is not contained to a single area and can seep slowly through different layers of the muscle.
</p>
                    <p>Many of the deeper muscles are wrapped with a tough tissue called fascia, forming compartments. Nerves and blood vessels are also contained
in these compartments. Bleeding into these deep muscles quickly fills the compartments, and can cause pressure on the nerves and blood vessels and damage to the muscle.</p>
                    <p>
Some muscles cross more than one joint. Movement at either joint might appear to be normal at first. However, if BOTH joints are tested at the same time the muscle bleed can be confirmed.</p>

                    <h5 style="color:#00b8d4;padding-top:3%"><b>TREATMENT OF A MUSCLE BLEED</b></h5>
                    <p>The first aid principles of R-R-I-I-C-E are recommended for all muscle bleeds.</p>
                    <p><b>R = Replacement</b> of clotting factor. Treat with factor <b>as directed by your treatment centre.</b></p>
                    <p><b>R = Rest.</b> Do not use this muscle while it is painful. Crutches, a wheelchair or even bed rest may be needed when there is a bleed in a leg muscle. Use a sling to rest bleeds into the arm muscles.</p>
                    <p><b>I = Ice.</b> Ice may help to decrease pain if the muscle bleed is not too deep. An ice pack, gel pack or crushed ice can be used. Always wrap the ice in a damp towel first; do not apply ice directly to the skin.<br>For best relief, wrap the ice around the muscle. For large muscle bleeds up to 20 minutes may be needed. Re-apply the ice every two hours for the first two to three days, or until the pain has decreased. <b>Do not use ice if it is making the pain worse.</b></p>
                    <p><b>I = Immobilization.</b> If there is a lot of pain and loss of motion, a splint or half cast may be used to allow the muscle to relax. Splints can also be useful for young children who may not understand that they need to rest. See page 24 - WHEN TO IMMOBILIZE. Your HTC/physiotherapist will advise you what type of immobilization should be used and for how long.</p>

FOR ALL MUSCLE BLEEDS</b></h5>
                    <p>Treatment, as directed by your HTC, must be continued until the muscle is healed completely and its strength is restored. If you return to sports or work too early, there is a good chance that the muscle will re-bleed. It is important to do the correct exercises to regain full strength and flexibility in your muscle. Contact your physiotherapist for recommendations before you go back to regular activities, including sports or work.</p>

                    <p>The hamstring muscles are located along the back of the thigh. Their job is to extend the hip and to bend the knee. They can be injured by a sudden stretch or by overuse. When teenagers go through a growth spurt, these muscles may not be able to stretch enough to keep up with the rapid growth of the bones. This makes them more likely to be injured, especially during sports. Hamstrings can also become tight after knee bleeds because they tighten up to protect the knee.</p>

                    <p>The quadriceps muscle (quads) is a group of four muscles located on the front of the thigh. Their main job is to extend the knee; the most superficial of these muscles also helps to bend the hip. The quads can be injured by a sudden forceful stretch, such as during sprinting without warming up first. More frequently, they are injured by a direct blow- e.g. contact with a baseball, or another player’s knee.</p>

                    <p>A half cast or removable splint is better than a full cast which could cut off circulation if the swelling increases. A splint should be left on for only two-three days and then the motion should be re-checked. More rest may be necessary to allow complete healing. However, longer periods of immobilization will lead to weakness and leave the area at risk for a new injury. You should see the physiotherapist for recommendations about exercise during and after immobilization.</p>
                    <p>If there are pins and needles or tingling which suggest nerve compression, contact your HTC immediately. Nerve compression should be treated as an emergency to prevent permanent damage. Observation in hospital may be recommended.</p>
